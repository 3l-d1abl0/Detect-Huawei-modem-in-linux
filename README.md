For all this time i used the network manager to interact with my Huawei modem. But craving for a Gui for Mobile Partner(like the one in windows ) on Linux i decided to install the Mobile Partner setup for Linux on my Debian.
On trying the installation i ended up getting an <b> "Install NDIS driver failed "</b> error.
